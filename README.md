# Keybinding Philosophy

Using a new Kinesis Advantage 360 has helped reduce wrist pain and
makes for a much nicer typing experience in general, but there are
still things need adjusting.

## Keys too far to reach
Some keys are still simply too far to reach without greatly adjusting
the hand position, such as the default = and _ positions as well as a
few of the thumbkeys such as the windows and alt keys. Emacs also
makes certain keys more used than others such as ctrl and alt. Then
there's the desire to make as many of the more used programming symbol
keys easier to access, either with one keystroke or on the home row
for eaiser access. Finally, the enter key has always been a bit of a
bomb as it would inevitibly be hit when was typing a different
character such as ' in standard keyboards or space in the case of the
Advantage 360.

There is also the consideration of controlling the window manager
outside of emacs when using multiple screens as provided by gnome or
any tiling window manager.
